I went from broke to millionaire in 7 years on a middle-class income thanks to Bitcoin,5582,1h7ie4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h7ie4r/i_went_from_broke_to_millionaire_in_7_years_on_a/,464,1733429143.0,"I'm posting this anonymously for obvious reasons.

I shared my story here four years ago. If you are curious, you can find it. I've been involved with r/Bitcoin since the summer of 2017 when I first bought Bitcoin in the $2,000 range. I distinctly remember celebrating 250,000 subs here, and this subreddit has been a great educational and meme-motivational resource over that time. 

The Bull Market of 2017 was a wild ride. I experienced my first FOMO as the price went from $2,000 to $20,000. During that up-and-down cycle, I bought around one whole Bitcoin. I bought another full Bitcoin when it dropped to $4,000 in 2018. I felt satisfied with my 2 BTC, but my confidence waned so I didn’t continue stacking over the next 2 years. 

In the spring of 2020, I sold my house, switched jobs, and suddenly found myself sitting on $30,000 in cash from the sale of my home and around 55k in a 401k. I watched as Bitcoin went from 4k to 7, 8, 9, 10, instead of going down to zero as the critics claimed. I decided to go “all-in” with these funds so that’s what I did. I bought around 3 Bitcoin with the cash and the equivalent of just under 5 BTC in GBTC in a new 401k. This brought me to just under 10 Bitcoin split between private custody and a 401k. 

I watched history repeat itself in the fall of 2020, but this time, I had some real exposure to better gains. I watched as my life savings went from around $100,000 to over $600,000 at the top of the cycle in early 2021. Then, I watched as my roughly $600,000 returned to around $170,000 during the bottom of the bear market in 2022. That was tough to witness, but I looked at it and said “I’m still up from where I started.” Once you get past a certain amount of savings, the big swings hit differently. Even during the bear market, I knew I still had at least a 1-year emergency fund, which comforted me.Fast-forward to a short while ago when Bitcoin hit 92k. I soon realized that with the equity in our home and my exposure to BTC, my wife and I were finally millionaires. We’re still driving the same beater cars to work. I rarely sell our BTC, but when I do, I try to buy things/ experiences that will improve the quality of life for my family, and I’m quick to replace what I sold.   
  
I make a middle-class income so I don’t often need to sell for the things I want/ need. Whenever I see a used car, 4-wheeler, boat, or new home I’m tempted to buy, I think to myself “I’d rather have Bitcoin.” The peace of mind it offers far outweighs the benefits of more junk. I used to tell myself I’d pay off my mortgage using proceeds from Bitcoin, but my mortgage is only about 9% of my take-home pay, and the interest rate is lower than inflation. I believe we will see 250k-280k by the end of next year, and the cycle will start again.   
  
One downside to having such a nice safety net is that work has become very tedious. I have very little motivation to put in the extra time or to go “above and beyond.” I do my job, I do it well, I make money for my employer, but I’m not pushing for more like I would if I were still broke. I’ll post again in four more years with an update. I’m hoping to retire by 2030-2034. Stay safe out there, and only invest in Bitcoin what you’re willing to keep!"

"I got scammed for ~11k, here's what happened",184,1h7xhx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h7xhx2/i_got_scammed_for_11k_heres_what_happened/,79,1733476702.0,"A very unfortunate thing happened yesterday and I made one huge mistake that cost me about 11.3k$. 
I like to think I'm smart and cautious, but yesterday a group of scammers got me and I feel very stupid. This is the story so others don't make the same mistakes.

I use binance as my main exchange but have most of my crypto on a cold wallet. I used to log into binance using 2 factor authentication and a security code I got via SMS every time. From the same short message channel, I got a message that there was a login attempt from egypt (I'm not from egypt). I typically get messages like that when I log into a new laptop, but this time there was a phone number included. The history of messages in the message channel goes back 3 years and includes login verification codes, deposit confirmarion, etc.  and for some reasom I trusted it. There was a support number in the message in case the login was not from oneself and since I'm not from egypt I decided to act and called the support number. There was a voice memo asking whether I am a Binance user or not. I confirmed and was connected to a guy with a british accent (fuck you). He asked me for the reference number in the message and explained that my account has been compromised and that I must follow him step by step to protect my funds so that they are safe and covered by insurance. In hindsight I know how stupid this all sounds, but I was in holiday at a metro station when all of this happened and was heavily distracted. They got me in the perfect moment. So this guy was very sophisticated and polite and made me trust him. He said things like ""This is usually the time when we expect hacks like this when prices are high"" and that ""I'm not the only one"" and that we must protect the funds. He wanted me to install trustwallet and send the funds there and said this is standard protocol and only when I do it will my asstes be covered by insurance. I grew skeptical, but for whatever reason I went along. While following his instructions I ran into some problems with the binance app and the guy connected me to another guy who actually helped me with it. This second guy then told me to setup trustwallet, which I had already because I used it for a while, and told me I must send the funds there. However, here comes the part where I make a decisive, huge and very easily identifiable mistake. He wanted me to set up a new wallet using a seed phrase that he sent me via the original, legit binance text message channel. He claimed this is standard protocol and only this way can my funds be covered by insurance. Both scammers were really good at talking, gave a sense of safety and were very polite (fuck them). And thats when I fucked up. I sent the funds (11.3k) to the wallet that I just setup using the scammers seed and immediately it was withdrawn. Obviously. I realized immediately what just happened, felt like an absolute idiot and contacted real binance support and my local police department. Police is tracking my funds as we speak and will try to freeze them on an exchange, but I have little hope. 
Obvisouly I feel very stupid and ashamed that I fell for such an obvious scam, but it showed me that its easy to fall for them, especially when caught in a vulnerable situation like on a busy metro while you're on holiday. Only good thing is I have most of my crypto still in a cold wallet which is safe, but I lost over 11k in profits. So please don't make the same mistakes I made and keep your crypto on a cold wallet and trust no one. I defenitely learned my lesson. After 4+ years of being in crypto, I cannot believe I fell for this. But I did. The scammers got me and I gotta accept it and learn from it. Please don't hate on me, I know how stupid it was and obviously I'm already frustrated. In case the police does the impossible and recovers my funds, I will post an update. But I don't have any hopes tbh. "

Lets not forget who got us here: thank you Hal Finney!,2985,1h73g56,https://i.redd.it/03ude38nbz4e1.jpeg,103,1733382341.0,"
Hal Finney was the first person to download the Bitcoin software, the first person to suggest code fixes to Satoshi Nakamoto and the first peer to trustlessly receive a transaction – all before BTC had a quotable price.

Finney was tragically diagnosed with ALS in August 2009, seven months after he and Satoshi started working on Bitcoin together. ALS is a fatal disease that attacks the central nervous system and finally causes paralysis.

Finney maintained his positive outlook and good spirits despite the sluggish development of his task. “Since we’re all rich with Bitcoins, or we will be once they’re worth a million dollars like everyone expects, we ought to put some of this unearned wealth to good use,” he said in a post on the Bitcointalk site.

""My dream is to contribute to open source software projects even from within an immobile body. That will be a life very much worth living.""

**Modesty is THE hallmark of a legend.**
Truly missed...

Fun fact: In 2009 Hal Finney predicted $10M per Bitcoin. [He divided the world's wealth by 20 million and NOT 21 million](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/s/L71ePyfHbg). Did Hal imply that Satoshi would never spend his coins?"

I remember we talked for days about Bitcoin and predicted where the value would end up in certain time frames. I remember the teacher told us that Bitcoin was supposedly going to hit 100k at the end of 2018, well needless to say that was wrong. But I had to have the last word. Just before I was released from juvie the teacher that talked about Bitcoin with us came and spoke to me about how to get a head start on life when I get out. And the right investments to make. And just before he left I said these exact words ""crypto will be the most disappointing short term investment I make. But since I'm a gambler I'll betchu anything that in 6 years it'll finally hit that 100k mark"" I had always believed that me and the number 6 was lucky and indeed it has been so far.

# Have you ever wondered why your parents could buy a house and a car on one salary, but today we're all grinding just to keep up? 

Spoiler alert: it's not because stuff is actually getting more expensive—it's because our money is broken. 

Bitcoin fixes this.

**The Illusion of Expensive Stuff**

Technology is making everything more efficient. Think about it: producing goods is cheaper and faster than ever before. The natural order should be that prices *drop* over time. But thanks to money printing and inflation, we're stuck in a world where prices *seem* to rise. It's like running on a treadmill that's speeding up—you have to work harder just to stay in the same place.

**Bitcoin Flips the Script**

Bitcoin is deflationary by design. There's a capped supply, so it can't be devalued by printing more. When Bitcoin underpins the economy, it aligns with the natural order—stuff gets cheaper over time because your money holds its value (or even appreciates). That's not (only) because bitcoin is ""increasing in value"", rather, Bitcoin represents the true order of things. When our protocol for ""value"" is not expanding; you notice how the world is actually prosperous. Less ""stuff"" automatically funnels to the richest class just because they hold ""stuff"" (equities, homes, etc.) already.

**Housing: From Asset to Shelter**

For instance; have you ever thought about why houses are so expensive? It's not *just* demand; it's because people use real estate as a store of value to hedge against inflation. With Bitcoin as a reliable store of value, there's less incentive to park wealth in houses. This could *demonetize* housing, stripping away the investment premium and making homes more affordable for everyone.

**Better Savings for All**

When your money appreciates over time, saving becomes rewarding—not just for the rich but for everyone. You don't need complex investment strategies to preserve wealth. This encourages responsible spending and reduces unnecessary consumption driven by the fear of money losing value.

**Global Settlement and Fair Play**

Bitcoin as the default value-storing unit levels the playing field. International settlements become straightforward, transparent, and fair. No more currency manipulations or unfair advantages. Everyone operates with the same rules, benefiting global trade and cooperation.

**But Won't People Stop Spending?**

Not really. People still need to live, enjoy experiences, and buy stuff. I just bought a car half a year ago, for instance, knowing full and well that that money would have appreciated had I put it in Bitcoin—or stocks— instead. The key is that spending becomes more intentional. Instead of splurging because money is losing value, purchases are made based on actual need and desire. Plus, an appreciating currency doesn't halt spending—it just curbs wasteful consumption. In most cases, this is actually good for our planet as well.

So, in a nutshell: Bitcoin realigns the economy with the natural progression of technology and efficiency. Prices should fall; therefore savings should grow, and everyone gets a fair shot at prosperity. Whether you're born in Manhattan or Zanzibar.

Personally, I'm ready for a world where my money works *for* me, and not against me.

I remember talking to my brother about bitcoin eventually being worth over $1M but I was justifying it as crazy in my head. Then I watched it fall to less than $20k and talked myself out of it again because it was clearly not stable(justifying it to myself). Today I setup a twice a month reoccurring transfer with Coinbase to buy.

It’s not much, but it’s better to start now instead of later. Learning a lot going through this sub. Cheers to you all and good luck.

Edit: fixed a typo because I’m an idiot."

I remember buying it for literally like $100 or so a btc , would have to check my coinbase history.
Funny how it’s come this far, it used to be what the underground did to take payments, I come from Latin America and that was what everyone shifted to rather than Western Union or Money Gram. Bought $700 worth about 5 months after hearing about it being used for payments and now it grew to almost 100K a piece. 
Glad to see it being accepted, for years BTC was black market , now it is the market.
Enjoy brothers, I will never brag just a dummy that bought it and held 5.5 in coinbase and waiting to sell these, I still remember it hitting 5K and was laughing at how far it came, almost sold in 2019 and held off. Still don’t even know how to use it well, I guess it’s just an investment anymore rather than buying things with it in a hidden fashion."

For anyone looking for better understanding (even the veterans)

Want to better understand Bitcoin? Read on.

Bitcoin isn’t an investment. It’s the hardest form of money we as a species have ever had access to (hardness refers to how suitable or viable it is as money).

I have compiled a shortlist of videos to help aid your understanding. The 2nd video is the real gem in this list and it’s the clip that mostly gives you foundational base of knowledge in this space. It teaches you key concepts about money. Once these concepts are understood, you can look at Bitcoin & the US dollar and fully understand what makes bitcoin “money”, and the US dollar (a fiat currency).. and the implications of both.

There’s a lot of information here, and there’s so much more out there that can be learned of course. However, when you come out the other side of this information, you will have a solid foundation. This is the type of thing that puts you ahead of most people in the market as most people don’t understand these concepts. MOST people will never learn these things, and they will fall victim to the effects of flawed monetary systems. I hope this information finds you well."
How do you sell?,2,1h7x5jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h7x5jm/how_do_you_sell/,2,1733475140.0,"I’ve only ever bought and sold small numbers and heard scary stories of people who had their fiat locked up at kraken, Coinbase and other exchanges for a variety of reasons after making big sells. 

But if you had like 2-3 coins and wanted to sell that right now, do you go about it the same way as if you sold 0.15? Transfer it from wallet to exchange m, sell it for fiat and the withdrawal to you private bank account? It’s too little for advanced schemes, but definitely not pocket change anymore so this got me thinking about the problem.
